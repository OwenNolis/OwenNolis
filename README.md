# Hi there 👋, I'm Owen Nolis

🎮 I'm a 23-year-old **software and game developer** with a passion for creating impactful applications and immersive game experiences.  
🧠 Constantly learning and improving my skills — from building full-stack web apps to developing 2D and 3D games.

### 🚀 About Me

I'm currently studying **Applied Computer Science**, with hands-on experience in:

- **Web Development**: JavaScript, TypeScript, Angular, Node.js, Express, Deno, Oak, Java, C#, HTML, CSS, TailwindCSS
- **Databases**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Firebase Firestore, Redis, Deno KV
- **Mobile Development**: Flutter, Kotlin, Dart
- **Game Development**: Unity (C#), MonoGame
- **Tools & Frameworks**: GitHub, Git, Swagger, Docker, Jenkins, AWS, Gitlab, Deno Deploy

I'm always looking for opportunities to **learn new technologies**, **tackle challenging projects**, and **collaborate with other developers**. Whether it's backend APIs or player mechanics in a game, I'm excited to keep pushing my limits.
